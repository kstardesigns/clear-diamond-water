			<h2>Flint Mission</h2>
			<p>Tens of thousands of homes in Flint, Michigan have been impacted by a toxic water crisis.  High levels of lead in Flint’s water makes the water undrinkable and unsafe for everyday use. The only clean water option residents have is through bottled water, which is not only costly, but it’s a near-impossible way of living. Sending bottled water to Flint 
residents has been a helpful, yet temporary solution and we feel there is a better option.</p>
			<p style="clear: both;">Clear Diamond Water can provide a sustainable program to keep residents safe from the lead and contaminants in Flint’s water with our in-house filtration system. Our product removes 99.95% of lead and our filters are certified by the NSF for this application. Better yet, our product has already been tested in Flint and is located ACI Plastics. The mayor of Flint has reviewed the product and it has been proven to remove the lead contaminate successfully.</p>
            <p>Our filter housing is constructed with space-age resin at a high-performance level never seen before by any other filter housing material and can withstand pressures and temperatures that exceed NSF (National Sanitation Foundation) standards. This is what makes our product outperform all other housings currently on the market. Our product is also clear, which means the filtration process can be observed; the contaminated water can be seen coming into the filter, followed by the clean water coming into the home.</p>
            <p>Clear Diamond Water aims to provide a suitable, low-cost solution to the Flint water crisis. We want to improve the quality of living for Flint residents who are suffering due to the toxic, unusable water in their homes. We are reaching out to the residents in Flint and to concerned citizens who want to help get clean water back into homes. </p>
